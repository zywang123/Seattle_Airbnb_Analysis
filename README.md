### Motivation for the project
At present, due to economic problems and war happened, banks have raised interest rates and thus affect the housing market price, so the price of Airbnb has also changed. Therefore I chose to look at the pre-pandemic 2015-2016 Seattle Airbnb data. Before the pandemic, no mask was required and oil price was reasonable, which travelers were all around the world, thus Airbnb started to take off. However recently a firestorm over fees on Airbnb erupted on social media, in which most customers pointed out the hotel was much cheaper then Airbnb and hotel became a better option. Therefore, I would like to find what important factors affect Airbnb price a lot and correlation between price and those factors.
